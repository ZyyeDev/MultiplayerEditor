# 0.0.2
- **Fixed a crash that occurred when opening the Level Settings menu while in a session.**
- **Fix clients overriting host's level settings when joining.**
- **Fixed "ERROR_MOD_NOT_FOUND" error.**
Keep in mind this version is still super buggy, so please make backups of your levels regularly.

# 0.0.1
First version of the mod! For now it has simple functionality just enough to work.
We are still on progress of adding full compatibility with everything.
