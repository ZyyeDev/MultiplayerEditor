# Multiplayer Editor

A multiplayer Geometry Dash mod for building levels with others, made using [enet](https://github.com/lsalzman/enet).

⚠️ **Development Status**: This mod is functional but incomplete. 
I'm releasing it publicly in hopes that someone might want to contribute, and **I'm not actively developing it anymore**. Not all object properties sync yet because I can't find them anywhere.

## Installation

1. Install [Geode](https://geode-sdk.org/)
2. Download the latest release from the [Releases page](#)
3. Place the `.geode` file in your `geode/mods` folder
4. Launch Geometry Dash

This mod uses **P2P**, we recommend to use [Hamachi](https://vpn.net/) or similar to create a virtual LAN
