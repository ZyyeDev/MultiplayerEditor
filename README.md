# Multiplayer Editor

A multiplayer Geometry Dash mod for building levels with others, made using [enet](https://github.com/lsalzman/enet).

# ⚠ WARNING: THIS MOD IS IN VERY EARLY STAGES OF DEVELOPING!!!
Please expect bugs. **Always back up your levels before using it!**

Also, keep in mind that not many object or level properties sync yet. Geode bindings doesn't have all of them at the moment (or maybe I just haven't found them). I'm trying to work on a solution for this!

## Installation

1. Install [Geode](https://geode-sdk.org/)
2. Download the latest release from the [Releases page](#)
3. Place the `.geode` file in your `geode/mods` folder
4. Launch Geometry Dash

This mod uses **P2P**, we recommend to use [Hamachi](https://vpn.net/) or similar to create a virtual LAN
